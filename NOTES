Satallax 2.7-isar

Fork of Satallax 2.7 with capability to produce Isar scripts for Satallax refutations.

Bulding: follow Satallax instructions.

License: unchanged from Satallax (check requirements).

Notes:
* Not all tab_ rules are currently handled.
* Fix the bit which disables Coq proofs; need to be able to output either proofs, on user's command.
* Hardcoded Isar code.
* Duplication of Coq code.
* Relying on Coq code for normalisation -- but this seems to be good enough. Perhaps should rename.
* Testing is a bit inconvenient.
* Sometimes blast isn't strong enough. For instance when run
    ./bin/satallax -m mode188 -p isar /home/nik/TPTP-v5.5.0/Problems/SYO/SYO277^5.p
   get this step
      from H1 obtain eigen__0 where H5 : "(~((! X1::i. ((! X2::(i=>o). ((X2 eigen__0) --> (X2 X1))) = (! X2::(i=>(i=>o)). ((! X3::i. ((X2 X3) X3)) --> ((X2 eigen__0) X1)))))))" by blast
   but "blast" takes ages. Replacing it with "auto" works fine.
* Add comments making clear which rule used when this isn't obvious.
* Sometimes Satallax's Coq output does some search (e.g., through use of "||"-branching). Currently this isn't automated in the Isar output -- instead the user needs to edit the script manually. (The script will include comments drawing the user's attention to this.)
