; Modification of mode13 that has
; *instantiate-with-func-diseqn-sides* nil
; and some other modifications from Dec 29 2009.

; Chad E Brown
; The problem motivating this mode is ALG290^5.
; Upon close examination, it seems to need to only do 1 trivial 1st order instantiation (with a const coming from an exists)
; and hardly any propositional reasoning.  For this reason I'm delaying everything after an and/nand, and delaying most foralls.
; This mode can now prove ALG290^5 in about a second. - Chad, Dec 29 2009
