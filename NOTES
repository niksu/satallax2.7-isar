Satallax 2.7-isar

Fork of Satallax 2.7 with capability to produce Isar scripts for Satallax refutations.

Bulding: follow Satallax instructions.

License: unchanged from Satallax (check requirements).

Notes:
* Not all tab_ rules are currently handled.
* Fix the bit which disables Coq proofs; need to be able to output either proofs, on user's command.
* Hardcoded Isar code.
* Duplication of Coq code.
* Relying on Coq code for normalisation -- but this seems to be good enough. Perhaps should rename.
* Testing is a bit inconvenient.

Ack: Chad Brown

Testing, to discover currently-unhandled tab_* rules:
awk '{ print $2 }' ~/xoghol/isabelle-thf/TPTP_550_sizes | xargs -I X ./test_for_tab X
